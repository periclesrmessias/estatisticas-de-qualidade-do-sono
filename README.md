[Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOWIwYjExYjQtYjY0YS00NDEyLTk4YTgtMWYwNzBjMmNmZTY0IiwidCI6IjIwNDBmZGQ4LWI0NTUtNDUyOC05NjNkLTUxZTFmNDNlZjQ0NyJ9)

This dashboard works with a fictitious [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hanaksoy/health-and-sleep-statistics) from Kaggle and focus on
sleep health and lifestyle related factors, such as:
- Sleep Quality: which ranges from 4-9, with 9 being the highest quality.
- Daily Routine: including bedtime, wake-up time, dietary habits.
- Physical Activity Level: from low to high, daily calories burned, daily steps
taken.
• Health Indicators: presence of sleep disorders and medication usage
The goal of this analysis is to identify which lifestyle factors are most associated with
good sleep quality and to uncover insights that could help improve it.

## Findings
A key finding from the analysis is that inactive men in their 40s are more likely to
experience poor sleep quality. Men with low sleep quality often rely on medication,
have unhealthy dietary habits, go to bed later, and exhibit a higher prevalence of sleep
disorders.
The dashboard clearly demonstrates that physical activity plays a crucial role in
achieving good sleep quality. Individuals who engage in regular exercise report
significantly better sleep, while those who remain inactive struggle with poorer sleep
patterns. Notably, 95% of individuals in this dataset reporting sleep disorders are men.
These men also display concerning health patterns, such as late bedtimes and poor
dietary choices, which seem to significantly impact their sleep quality.
In contrast, women in this dataset show better overall health indicators, including
fewer sleep disorders and lower reliance on medication. They tend to report higher
sleep quality, particularly when they maintain a healthy routine and stay active.

## Actionable Insights
Based on these findings, companies could explore several strategies:
- Health Programs: Target inactive men in their 40s with health programs that
combine physical activities, personalized dietary plans, and medical checkups to
address sleep disorders and medication use.
- Targeted Marketing: Brands offering sleep aids, from apps to pharmaceuticals,
could benefit from focusing marketing on this demographic through social
media or other channels.
##Limitations
While this dataset was relatively clean and manageable, I would prefer to work with a
larger, real-world dataset that covers a wider age range. Although I made minimal
changes, creating a new table to calculate each person's sleep duration, there was no
need for extensive data cleaning or modeling.
In future projects, I aim to tackle more complex datasets that require thorough data
cleaning and modeling. This experience will allow me to practice these crucial data
analysis steps and enhance my skills.

## Feedback and Insights
What do you think of the dashboard? Were the visualizations easy to understand?
Since I didn’t create many custom measures, did you experience any slowdowns while
interacting with it?
I’m still working on balancing learning new tools with meeting deadlines, but I’m
excited to start working on another project like this! If you have any feedback, tips, or
just want to chat about data, feel free to reach out and message me
directly.
